Oh! Hey there!
I didn't think you'd find me!
You're smarter than the last one...
... ... ...
You know, most people say 'thank you' after receiving a compliment...
...
Fine then...hey! Want to play a game?
I'll race you to the top floor!
Ready...
Set...
...WAIT!...
I almost forgot, a tip for those sconces, in case you can't manage on your own.
The numbers in the book...One column is the amount, and one the position!
Feel free to keep whatever you find...I always get it back! Hahaha...
Go!

You've found me!
Very good, very good indeed!
Now, how are you enjoying my basement?
The dead have turned it into a bit of a mess, I know.
But I think that just adds character!
...
... ... ...
No? Not a conversationalist I see.
Fine then, you go on ahead.
If you want to get home, you'll have to defeat the specter.
He's around here somewhere...
Then just walk on through the portal and be on your way!
...
One more thing...if you can't figure out those colored tiles yourself then...
Just go have a look around where the dead sleep! Ha!
...
Alright then...bye!

Well isn't this a surprise! Only one other person ever made it this far!
You're stronger than you look!
I know you aren't one for conversation, so let's just get down to it.
Welcome to my garden!
It's so serene and peaceful here, all the pretty trees and plant monsters just waiting to eat you!
...
I just love it so much!
... 
Right......Listen, you're almost home. You just need to unlock these doors behind me.
Beyond the doors is the portal home...sort of.
There are five doors, and five keys.
I left around here somewhere...
...But I just can't remember where...
...You know, the last guy that came through found all but one of them.
I'm sure they've gone back to their hiding places since then...
Last I remember, he was heading SouthEast to cut down some big tree. Never came back after that.
...
Well...Good luck!
