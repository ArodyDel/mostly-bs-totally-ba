You've found me!
Very good, very good indeed!
Now, how are you enjoying my basement?
The dead have turned it into a bit of a mess, I know.
But I think that just adds character!

No? Not a conversationalist I see.
Fine then, you go on ahead.
If you want to get home, you'll have to defeat the specter.
He's around here somewhere...
Then just walk on through the portal and be on your way!
...
One more thing...if you can't figure out those colored tiles yourself then...
Just go have a look around where the dead sleep! Ha!

Alright then...bye!
